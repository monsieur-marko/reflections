When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository when I want to share code with collaborators, showcase my projects, or intend to work on the codebase from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If changes were made to the branch in the remote repository that you're not aware of, automatically pulling may create problems.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: cloned and linked repository containing all files and commits as of the time forked. GitHub feature.
Clones: copy of a repository containing all files and commits as of the time forked. Git feature.
Branches: Local version of the repository developed in parallel with another branch. Git feature.

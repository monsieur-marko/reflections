What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It adds the git metadata to the system folder. You need to commit the tracked files, so that git will track future updates to these files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a collection of files in limbo. It offers users the ability to review changes before they are made.

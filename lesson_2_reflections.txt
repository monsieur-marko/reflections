How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a collection of files in limbo. It offers users the ability to review changes before they are made.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By being prompted to comment on each commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When changing core code or developing two versions in parallel.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

I can see the commit hierarchy.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The result is a sequential reordering of the changes in the files. We represent it this way in the diagram because we see that the reordering is of parallel files.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Automatically merging is quicker, but may result in redundant or even logically-buggy code. Manual merging takes more time, but is less error-prone.
